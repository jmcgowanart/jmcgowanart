### is-flex class
The 'is-flex' class which can be seen in the stylesheet is used to make sure all columns are identical size... as sometimes with Bootstrap, the columns can appear at different heights and can be quite annoying to fix. 


### Git Command Line 

In order to set up the project for use with git on the command line, I needed to run the below commands in order to change the login from my original kainos account, to the jmcgowan1 account...

    git config user.name jmcgowan1
    git config user.email jmcgowan1@hotmail.co.uk

Only when you go to push the code up to the repo does it ask you for the password associated with the github account.
