# Joanne McGowan Art Website 

This is a static website which is used for displaying and selling artwork for github user jmcgowanart, email jmcgowan1@hotmail.co.uk. 

It is comprised of an index.html, as well as css, js and img folders. Bootstrap has been added to the project and that resides in the css and js folders.

### Git Command Line 

In order to set up the project for use with git on the command line, I needed to run the below commands in order to change the login from my original kainos account, to the jmcgowan1 account...

    git config user.name jmcgowan1
    git config user.email jmcgowan1@hotmail.co.uk

Only when you go to push the code up to the repo does it ask you for the password associated with the github account.
